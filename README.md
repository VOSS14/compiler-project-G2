Compiler Design Mini Project Report1. IntroductionThis project focuses on the Syntax Analysis phase of compiler design. The objective is to implement and demonstrate two primary parsing techniques: Recursive Descent Parsing (a Top-Down approach) and LALR Parsing Simulation (a Bottom-Up approach). These parsers determine if a source string conforms to the rules defined by a specific Context-Free Grammar (CFG).2. Grammar RulesThe parsers are designed to validate strings based on the following grammar:$A \rightarrow aBa$$B \rightarrow bB \mid \epsilon$Explanation of the Grammar:A valid string must start with the terminal character 'a'.The middle section (B) can contain any number of 'b' characters (including zero, which is the $\epsilon$ or "epsilon" case).The string must end with the terminal character 'a'.Examples of accepted strings: aa, aba, abba, abbba.3. Implementation Details (Group G2)Task 3.1: Recursive Descent ParserThis is implemented using a set of recursive functions in C++. Each non-terminal in the grammar ($A$ and $B$) is represented by a function. The program "matches" tokens from the input string; if the input matches the expected sequence of the grammar rules, the string is accepted.Task 3.2: LALR Parsing SimulationThe LALR (Look-Ahead Left-to-Right) parser is a more powerful bottom-up parser. Our implementation simulates the Shift-Reduce mechanism using a Stack.Shift: The parser moves a symbol from the input buffer to the stack.Reduce: When a sequence on the stack matches the right side of a grammar rule, it is replaced (reduced) by the left-side non-terminal.Accept: If the stack reaches the starting symbol and the input is empty, the string is valid.4. Results and TestingThe implementation was tested using the string abba.Recursive Descent Result: SUCCESS. The program successfully navigated the function calls for $A$ and $B$ to match the input.LALR Trace Result: ACCEPT. The trace shows the parser shifting states ($S1, S2, S3$) and successfully reaching the end of the input string ($).5. ConclusionThe mini-project successfully demonstrates the core logic of syntax analyzers. By implementing both Recursive Descent and LALR logic, we have shown how compilers use different mathematical models to ensure that code follows the structural rules of a programming language.
